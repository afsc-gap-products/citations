# Contribute to this repo and community `.bib` file

This repository is meant to act as a resource for all members of GAP and beyond. Do you see that a citation is missing from our `.bib` file or you have a new publication? Please add it by submitting a [pull request](`r paste0(link_repo, "/pulls")`) or speaking to one of the repository maintainers. 

# Citation style guides

The NOAA Library now recommends that we use [American Psychological Association 7th edition (no ampersand)](https://www.zotero.org/styles/apa-no-ampersand) for citing in NOAA technical memorandums and other NOAA process report publications. Learn more about APA 7th from this [Purdue Owl](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/reference_list_author_authors.html) resoure.

![APA 7th no Ampersand](./img/apa7.png)

The citation style guide for APA 7th can be downloaded from [github](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles). This independent open source Citation Style Language (CSL) project aims to facilitate scholarly communication by automating the formatting of citations and bibliographies. 

# How to cite

Add the link to the [`.bib`](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/citations/blob/main/cite/bibliography.bib) and [`.csl`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/apa-no-ampersand.csl) files in the YAML of your `rmarkdown` ro `quarto` file like so:

## As local files

Note that "../" before the file names refers to directory navigation. 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
---
title: "untitled"
date: "`r paste0(format(Sys.time(), '%B %d, %Y'))`"
output: html_document
csl: "../cite/citestyle.csl"
bibliography: "../cite/bibliography.bib"
---

```

To download the CSL and save it to your project, you can use the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
csl <- readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/apa-no-ampersand.csl")
readr::write_lines(x = csl, file = "./cite/citestyle.csl")

bib <- readLines("https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/citations/blob/main/cite/bibliography.bib")
readr::write_lines(x = bib, file = "./cite/bibliography.csl")
```

## Sourcing directly from github

Sourcing directly from github requires internet access, but ensures that you will always have the most up to date citation style library and bibliography references. 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
---
title: "untitled"
date: "`r paste0(format(Sys.time(), '%B %d, %Y'))`"
output: html_document
csl: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/apa-no-ampersand.csl"
bibliography: "https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/citations/blob/main/cite/bibliography.bib"
---

```

# Citation files in action

Use the `[@...]` notation in your `rmarkdown` or `quarto` call a reference number for a citation. 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
For example, here are **Annual Bering Sea Data Report** [@2022NEBS2022; @2021NEBS2022; @2019NEBS2022; @2018EBS2022]
```

*Which renders as:*

For example, here are **Annual Bering Sea Data Report** [@2022NEBS2022; @2021NEBS2022; @2019NEBS2022; @2018EBS2022]

Naturally, without writing anything else, references will appear at the of the document. If you want them to render at a specific place in your document, call the code below: 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
<div id="refs"></div>
```

*Which renders as:*

<div id="refs"></div>

# Cite R packages used in a project

Here is how the user can find all of the packages ever installed on the local computer

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
PKG <- tibble::tibble(
  Package = names(installed.packages()[,3]),
  Version = unname(installed.packages()[,3])
)
head(PKG)
```

Here is how the user can find all of the packages ever installed on the local computer

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
PKG <- names(sessionInfo()[7][[1]])
```

Then to cite them, create a .bib file for R packages:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::write_bib(x = PKG,
                 file = "./cite/bibliography_RPack.bib")
```

*Which looks like*

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
readLines(con = "./cite/bibliography_RPack.bib", n = 8)
```
