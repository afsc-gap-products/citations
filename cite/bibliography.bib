  abstract = {This study retrospectively examined evidence of ocean climate regime shift effects on epifauna and demersal fish of {Norton Sound, Alaska}, northeast {Bering Sea}, based on triennial bottom-trawl surveys from 1976 to 2002. Throughout the period, benthic fauna was dominated by sea stars (48–78\\%), followed by cods (5–19\\%), flatfish (5–15\\%), sculpins (1.5–7\\%), and crabs (2–6\\%). From 1976 to 2002, the cpue index of total species increased exponentially (4.5\\% y−1) by threefold with some declines in 1991 and 1999. The increase was also observed in sea stars (5.1\\% y−1), flatfish (6.1\\% y−1), and crabs (2.5\\% y−1). However, trends of cods and sculpins were mixed. Regression analysis showed the cpue index of total species to be positively correlated with survey years and bottom-water temperature. However, bottom-water temperature, when considered by itself, was not significant. Results suggest that regime shifts caused biomass increases of {Norton Sound} epifauna and demersal fish.},

  abstract = {Yellowfin sole (Limanda aspera) is an abundant, commercially harvested flatfish that ranges across the northern and southeastern Bering Sea continental shelf. In recent years, the summer bottom trawl survey of the southeastern Bering Sea (SEBS) conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) extended into the northern Bering Sea (NBS) in August. This opportunity allowed for describing yellowfin sole reproductive parameters in the NBS, such as female length and age at maturation, reproductive status, and sex ratio distribution. Estimates of 50% female sexual maturity were 10.11 years (A50; 95% CI: 9.47–10.76 years; n = 209) and 28.47 cm (L50; 95% CI: 27.16–29.68 cm; n = 212). Histology indicated much of the mature population was approaching the end of spawning. Yellowfin sole spawning timing (summer) appears to be synchronous across the NBS and SEBS. There is evidence that part of the yellowfin sole spawning population in the NBS is connected to a recognized spawning migratory group from the SEBS. A higher proportion of females than males was observed, which varied by year and stratum. This was negatively related to warmer bottom temperature and positively related to location (western longitudes and northern latitudes). Yellowfin sole females in the NBS exhibit a similar size and age of maturation, depth of spawning, and sex ratio proportions with those females inhabiting the SEBS. These results provide further information for fisheries managers on the yellowfin sole stock throughout this region. Spatial and temporal aspects of reproduction, however, should be more thoroughly investigated.}

  keywords = {Empirical orthogonal function, Sea-ice extent, Eastern Bering Sea, Bottom trawl, Vector autoregressive spatio-temporal model},
abstract = {Multivariate data reduction techniques are widely used to describe modes of variability in atmospheric and oceanographic conditions for the world’s oceans. Dominant modes of variability such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are typically defined as a statistical summary of physical measurements, and include both principle components representing modes of variability over time, and an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) giving the spatial pattern associated with a positive or negative phase for each mode. Typically, these indices are compared with biological conditions to describe or predict physical drivers of ecological dynamics. In some circumstances, however, it may instead be useful to apply EOF analysis directly to biological measurements, estimating indices of biological variability as well as maps of biological response associated with each index. We therefore develop a generalization of EOF analysis that can be applied directly to multispecies biological samples using a multivariate spatio-temporal model. These biologically derived indices can then be compared with relevant indices derived from physical data, or used as covariates in spatially-varying coefficient models. We first show that a spatio-temporal model can replicate previous EOF estimates of the PDO and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. We then identify three axes of variability in the eastern Bering Sea using biomass-sampling data for fourteen bottom-associated fishes and decapod crustaceans from 1982 to 2017. The first axis represents habitat preferences that are stable over time, and the second represents a multi-decadal trend in distribution for most species; for example, showing an increasing density for Alaska skate and arrowtooth flounder in the middle and inner domain. Finally, the third axis shows high interannual variability from 1982 to 1998 switching to multiyear stanzas from 1999 to 2017 and is highly correlated (0.87) with the extent of the cold bottom temperatures in this region and associated impacts on Alaska pollock and Pacific cod. These axes represent ecological dynamics for adult fishes and therefore integrate the impact of bottom-up and top-down processes, and they also confirm the importance of cold-pool extent for fish distribution in the Bering Sea while visualizing its varied impact on individual species. Moreover, this spatio-temporal approach allows oceanographers to define annual indices representing modes of variability in diverse biological communities from widely available field-sampling data.}

  abtract = {In the summer and fall of 1982 the Northwest and Alaska Fisheries Center and the Far Seas Fish. Res. Laboratory of Japan conducted a comprehensive cooperative survey of groundfish and invertebrate resources of the eastern Bering Sea. A Japanese vessel sampled resources on the continental slope with a bottom trawl while four U.S. vessels sampled resources over a major portion of the continental shelf using bottom trawls and hydroacoustic- midwater trawling techniques. Results of the survey are presented here in the form of a data report. Methods are described but results are presented largely in tables and figures, without a narrative description of findings. For principal families and species of groundfish and invertebrates, distributions are illustrated and abundance estimates given. Additionally, size composition, and where available, age composition and growth characteristics are shown for individual species. Appendices to the report contain descriptions of trawl gear used during the survey and computer listings of individual station and catch data and data analyses. The discussion section, in addition to describing assumptions and limitations, compares abundance estimates from U.S.-Japan cooperative surveys in 1979, 1981, and 1982.}
